	@author Rostislav Khlebnikov <@catpic5buck>
	@custom:contributor Tim Clancy <@_Enoch>

	A contract for providing an EIP-712 signature-based approach for on-chain 
	direct royalty payments with royalty management as gated by an off-chain 
	validator.

	This approach to royalty management is a point of centralization on GigaMart. 
	The validator key gives its controller the ability to arbitrarily change 
	collection royalty fees.

	This approach is justified based on the fact that it allows GigaMart to offer 
	a gas-optimized middle ground where royalty fees are paid out directly to 
	collection owners while still allowing an arbitrary number of collection 
	administrators to manage collection royalty fees based on off-chain role 
	management semantics.

	@custom:date December 4th, 2022.
